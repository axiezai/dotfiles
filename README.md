My Dotfiles
---

### For new setups:
```
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Things to remember:
 - `zsh-autosuggestions` needs to be cloned into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins`, see `zsh-autosuggestions` github repo
 - `powerline-fonts` require fixing up font preferences in iterm2 to a powerline font.
